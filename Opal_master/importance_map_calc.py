#! thus there are natual fluctuations that can be used to calculate 
#! sensitivities with. 
#! If SUBTRACT_MEAN_C then subtract out the mean from the concentration field 
#! as this then follows the perturbation theory a bit more may be - try both.
#! ADD_EPSILON = the no added onto diagonal diagonal for conditioning of the Mel Petros sudo inverse...
#! if -ve then use the defaut value. 
#! C is the concentration fields
#! weight_nod contains the weights of the nodes used to calculate 
#! the functional F=sum(WEIGHT_NOD,C(:,ICON,ITIME))
#! NONODS is the no of nodes/CVs in the mesh
#! NCON is the no of concentration fields solved for each time level
#! NTIM is the no of time levels. 
#! NWINDOW is the no of time levels in the time window used to calculate 
#! the senitivies (importance map) so there will be NWINDOW sensitivties e.g. 40
